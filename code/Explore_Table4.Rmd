```

*Challenge: How can we help identify and assist people in industries most affected by COVID-19?*

```{r}
table4 = readxl::read_excel(here::here("data", "6291004.xls"),
                            sheet = "Data1",
                            col_names = TRUE,
                            skip = 9)
# take every third column because that contains original counts
table4 = table4[, seq(1, ncol(table4), 3)]
```

Make a table of industry names 

```{r}
names = readxl::read_excel(here::here("data", "6291004.xls"),
                            sheet = "Data1",
                            col_names = paste0("C", 1:61),
                            n_max = 10)
names = names[, seq(1, ncol(names), 3)]
colnames(names) = names[10, ]

names = lapply(names[1, ], function(x) sub("\\s+$", "", stringr::str_extract(x, "[^;]*")))
```
