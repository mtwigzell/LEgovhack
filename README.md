# Challenge:  

1. **Industry assistance during COVID-19**    
   How can we help identify and assist people in industries most affected by COVID-19?  

   *Many people have been heavily impacted by COVID-19. These impacts may be more than financial. ATO data may assist in identifying these people for targeted support, financial or otherwise. Identifying all impacted industries is a challenge. How do we know we are providing the full range of support to all people impacted.* 

# Datasets:  

## Datasets to help us identify people who need assistance:  

+ ATO taxation data (Pre COVID-19 data source on individuals by broad industry)  
  + https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/taxation-statistics-2017-18/resource/edb9a9aa-c977-4a7a-a1f9-515b7b2b1f32  

+ ABS Labour Force, ABS Characteristics of Employment  

+ Datasets identifying gaps in vulnerable people?  

+ Datasets around location of people applying for Jobkeeper/ Jobseeker?  

+ Smaller sections in industries that are more hard hit?  

## Datasets to help us identify COVID-19 zones:  

+ NSW COVID-19 location information  
  + https://data.gov.au/search?format=csv&format=arcgis%20rest%20service&page=2&q=covid  

# Ideas:  

**Phase 1:** Identify people in industries most affected by COVID-19?  
**Phase 2:** Determine how to assist them (i.e. financially)?
