# Challenge:  

1. **Industry assistance during COVID-19**    
   How can we help identify and assist people in industries most affected by COVID-19?  

   *Many people have been heavily impacted by COVID-19. These impacts may be more than financial. ATO data may assist in identifying these people for targeted support, financial or otherwise. Identifying all impacted industries is a challenge. How do we know we are providing the full range of support to all people impacted.* 

# Datasets:  
+ ATO taxation data (Pre-Covid19 data source)  
  + https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/taxation-statistics-2017-18  

+ ABS Labour Force, ABS Characteristics of Employment
