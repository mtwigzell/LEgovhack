# Challenge:  

1. **Industry assistance during COVID-19**    
   How can we help identify and assist people in industries most affected by COVID-19?  

   *Many people have been heavily impacted by COVID-19. These impacts may be more than financial. ATO data may assist in identifying these people for targeted support, financial or otherwise. Identifying all impacted industries is a challenge. How do we know we are providing the full range of support to all people impacted.* 

# Datasets:  

## Datasets to help us identify people who need assistance:  

+ ATO taxation data (Pre COVID-19 data source on individuals by broad industry)  
  + https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/taxation-statistics-2017-18/resource/edb9a9aa-c977-4a7a-a1f9-515b7b2b1f32  

+ ABS labour force detailed data  
  + https://beta.abs.gov.au/statistics/labour/employment-and-unemployment/labour-force-australia-detailed/latest-release  
  
+ DESE May 2020 job seeker data  
  + https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/job-seeker-data-may-2020/resource/62c7c4dc-4f47-489d-aa21-5f8d7c25c530  
  + Dataset contains very detailed demographical data.  

+ Datasets identifying data gaps describing vulnerable people?  
+ Datasets with more granular information on smaller sections in broad industries that have been hardest hit?  

## Datasets to help us identify COVID-19 zones:  

+ NSW COVID-19 location information  
  + https://data.gov.au/search?format=csv&format=arcgis%20rest%20service&page=2&q=covid  

# Ideas:  

**Phase 1:** Identify people in industries most affected by COVID-19?  
**Phase 2:** Determine how to assist them (i.e. financially)?
